    <h2>HTML Lists</h2>
    <p>HTML Lists are used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain one or more list elements. There are three different types of HTML lists:

        <li>Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul)</li>
        <li>Description List or Definition List (dl)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>HTML Ordered List or Numbered List</h3>
    <p>In the ordered HTML lists, all the list items are marked with numbers by default. It is known as numbered list also. The ordered list starts with ol tag and the list items start with li tag. </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ol>  
        <li>Aries</li>  
        <li>Bingo</li>  
        <li>Leo</li>  
        <li>Oracle</li>  
       </ol>  
    <h3>HTML Unordered List or Bulleted List</h3>

        <li>Bingo</li>  
        <li>Leo</li>  
        <li>Oracle</li>  
       </ul>  
    <h3>HTML Description List or Definition List</h3>
    <p>
        HTML Description list is also a list style which is supported by HTML and XHTML. It is also known as definition list where entries are listed like a dictionary or encyclopedia.

    The definition list is very appropriate when you want to present glossary, list of terms or other name-value list.

    The HTML definition list contains following three tags:
    <ol>
        <li>dl tag defines the start of the list.</li>
        <li>dt tag defines a term.</li>
        <li>dd tag defines the term definition (description).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <dl>  
        <dt>Aries</dt>  
        <dd>-One of the 12 horoscope sign.</dd>  
        <dt>Bingo</dt>  
        <dd>-One of my evening snacks</dd>
